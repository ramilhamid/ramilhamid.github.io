                                        we dream of, or in tormented chase of
                                        that demon phantom that, some time or
                                        other, swims before all
                                        <strong>human</strong> hearts; while
                                        chasing such over this round globe,
                                        they either lead us on in barren mazes
                                        or midway leave us whelmed.</p>
